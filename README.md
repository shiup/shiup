### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ So who am I ?  

I am a passionate software nerd (and proud of the term).  I love to solve problems, figure out how things work.  I am lucky to work with some of the smartest and nicest people in the industry, I learnt a lots from them (even when we don't always agree on the next step, or the solution)

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Who am I?

I'm a passionate software engineer with a deep curiosity for how things work and a love for solving complex problems. I'm proud to call myself a software nerd! Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with some of the brightest and kindest minds in the industry, constantly learning and growing from these experiencesâ€”even when we donâ€™t always see eye to eye on the next steps or solutions.

You can find my [resume here](https://github.com/shiup/shiup/blob/main/resume.md).

Iâ€™ve also created resources to help others tackle real-world challenges. For example, I recorded a guide on [using Postman to test OAuth2.0 with IBM API Connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ha7OST5WvQ), with a focus on the authorization code grant type.

In addition to recording content, Iâ€™ve contributed to various educational materialsâ€”sometimes scripting, organizing, or even leading the recordings myself. Here are a few examples:
- [OAuth with IBM API Connect: A Secure API Access Guide](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/IBM+API+ConnectA+Secure+API+Access+with+OAuth/1_l6r8scy7)
- [End-to-End API Security](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Secure+your+APIs+end-to-end/1_ucg6nms3)
- [API Security Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taior9PNqQs)
- [Enterprise API Security with Ease](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/enterprise-api-security)

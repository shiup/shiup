### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ So who am I ?  

I am a passionate software nerd (and proud of the term).  I love to solve problems, figure out how things work.  I am lucky to work with some of the smartest and nicest people in the industry, I learnt a lots from them (even when we don't always agree on the next step, or the solution)

My [resume](https://github.com/shiup/shiup/blob/main/resume.md) can be found here 

I recorded how to use [Postman to test OAuth2.0 with IBM APIConnect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ha7OST5WvQ), especially with authorization code grant type

I put together a series of video, scripting or providing the materials. In the rare case, I actually did the recordings ðŸ˜„  
- [official recording on how OAuth can be used with APIC](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/IBM+API+ConnectA+Secure+API+Access+with+OAuth/1_l6r8scy7)
- [Secure the APIs e2e](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Secure+your+APIs+end-to-end/1_ucg6nms3)
- [API Security Best Practise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taior9PNqQs)

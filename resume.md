- **Security Patents and Awards**
  - Holder of 4 patents covering security, spanning from securing firmware images during deployment to custom runtime decisions on execution control lists (RDECL). The RDECL patent, US-7730525, is considered particularly valuable for its On-Behalf-Of concept
    - [US-9626166-B1 - Common Secure Cloud Appliance Image and Deployment](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-9626166-B1)
      - Ensures that digital rights management (DRM) is maintained by allowing controlled access to content based on pre-defined rights or usage rules. It outlines mechanisms to authenticate users, manage access rights, and provide encrypted delivery of content to prevent unauthorized distribution or piracy
    - [US-9563781-B2 - Directional Optimization for Policy Evaluation](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-9563781-B2)
      - Focuses on improving the efficiency of evaluating policies in systems that enforce security or access control rules. The invention introduces methods for optimizing the order and direction in which policy rules are evaluated, reducing computational overhead and improving system performance. By prioritizing certain policies based on context or previous results, this approach enhances the speed and accuracy of policy enforcement, especially in large-scale environments with complex rule sets. It ensures that decisions are made faster without compromising security
    - [US-9094194-B2 - Method and System for Automating the Recovery of a Credential Store when a User Has Forgotten Their Password Using a Temporary Key Pair Created Based on a New Password Provided by the User](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-9094194-B2)
      - This patent is for a system that simplifies password recovery for users. When a user forgets their password, a temporary key pair is generated based on a new password provided by the user. This temporary key pair is then used to securely access and recover the credential store without compromising the user's stored data. This method enhances both security and user convenience during password recovery processes
    - [US-7730525-B2 - Method, System, and Computer Program Product for Limiting Authorization of an Executable Action to an Application Session](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-7730525-B2)
      - The present invention provides a method, system, and computer program product for limiting authorization of an executable action to an application session. A method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention comprises: generating an alert in response to an execution of an action in an application; and allowing a user to temporarily authorize the execution of the action for a current session of the application. The authorization for the execution of the action is removed when the current session of the application ends.Method, system, and computer program product for limiting authorization of an executable action to an application session

### Professional Experience

#### IBM - API Connect – Integration, San Jose, CA  
**Security Architect/Senior Technical Staff Member**  *2018 – Current*

- Architected, designed, and built a robust authentication and authorization framework, incorporating a customizable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model that enhanced product security
- Lead the efforts to secure FedRAMP, GovCloud and FISMA compliance, unlocking multimillion-dollar opportunities in the government sector
- Integrated with OEM partners to bolster AI runtime API security and stay ahead of evolving cyber threats which are unknown at the design time
- Led efforts to secure FedRAMP GovCloud and FISMA compliance, unlocking multimillion-dollar opportunities in the government sector.
- Integrated with OEM partners to bolster AI runtime API security and stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
- Drive security architecture discussions at high-profile conferences like APIDays, APIWorld, TechConf, THINKS and RSA, directly engaging with customers to capture new revenue streams and maintain a competitive advantage
- Reduced security vulnerabilities across deployments by 75%, by adopting secure pipeline to manage security vulnerabilities
- Regularly meet with customers to address security concerns and discuss API security architecture, best practice and understanding customers future direction
- Partner with product owners on defining and prioritizing the API security roadmap during release planning

#### IBM - DataPower, Cambridge/Littleton, MA  
**Security Architect/Engineer/Senior Technical Staff Member**  *2006 – 2018*

- Created and refined authentication/authorization (AAA) frameworks, ensuring compliance with extensible OIDC, OAuth, JW*, SAML, WS-Security open standards, which improved the product's security posture
- Engineered the first native OAuth provider in DataPower, the first support in the IBM integration portfolio.  The design remains the same after the 3rd generation rewrite.  The OAuth provider is chosen for the API Management solution due to its ability to handle thousand requests per second, and its flexibility
- Enhanced security protocols in the development and deployment phases, exceeding with IBM's internal security benchmarks
- Presented at key industry events and coordinated with external partners to enhance product offerings, driving revenue growth with each hardware refresh and release

#### IBM – Iris/Lotus, Westford, MA  
**Security Engineer/Team Lead**  *1997 – 2006*

- Orchestrated the first public open-source CA process for PKIX by IBM (Jonah) and Notes public/private key infrastructure, strengthening IBM’s internal and external security capabilities
- Programmed and maintained security systems including Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Execution Control Lists (ECLs), First Password Rules support on ensuring compliance with enterprise security standards

### Key Achievements

- Security hardening of the microservices infrastructure
  - Spearheaded the security hardening of microservices by implementing robust encryption protocols andauthentication, which mitigated risks of unauthorized access and decreased potential security breaches
  - The microservices hardening efforts pay off with the FISMA/GovCloud/FedRAMP exercises
- Leading the effort to drive FISMA/FedRAMP compliance by conducting a comprehensive gap analysis across product components
  - Worked closely with component leads and conducted interviews with external vendors to identify missing requirements
  - Defined necessary tasks, and ensure alignment with federal security standards, enabling the product to meet stringent regulatory benchmarks
  - Interacted with Product Owners and Release Managements to align the timeline to meet the commitment
- Introduce AI to API security for IBM API Connect
  - Integrated with vendors who are in the space.  This quickly positions IBM API Connect to be a player in the ever-changing runtime AI API security space
  - This integration bought new customers and additional revenue in the millions for IBM with minimal effort
- Championed ideas and possibilities of applying LLM to the development and governance phrase of the API.  This will result in the runtime API adaptive behavior changes, based on context, and developers with no knowledge on security to develop secured APIs
- Designed and built an extensible OAuth Provider support for IBM DataPower, which the extensible framework that is mirrored in all the subsequent gateway designs
- Holder of 4 patents, 2 Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards, Breakthrough Technical Eminence participant, mentor/mentee
